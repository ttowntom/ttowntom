### 👋 Hey there! I'm Torgeir - Front End Development student and a tech enthusiast at heart.

After spending years crafting WordPress pages and exploring the depths of WooCommerce, I have found that the time is ripe to delve into the world of HTML, CSS and JS. I'm not just about the front end; my proficiency extends to SQL, Mongo DB, and the versatility of bash scripting. My Linux powered home lab server is where I play around with my curiosity and dedication for all things tech and code, hosting Docker, Zigbee for smart home automation, and NodeRed to complement my JavaScript adventures.

🛠️ **Current Projects:**

- **Automating Business Intelligence:** Developing a system to gather and filter public company data, creating a refined list of potential customer leads.
- **Custom Email Scripts:** Crafting scripts that generate personalized emails to our platform users, offering performance feedback and improvement tips.

📚 **Education and Growth:** My studies at Noroff are a deep dive into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the groundwork for future exploration into libraries and frameworks. In addition I'm taking courses that I find relevant and interesting over at Udemy.

💡 **What Drives Me:** I thrive on building and creating, whether it's through coding, carpentry, or setting up intricate smart home systems. My project management and planning skills are honed from a diverse background that includes a vibrant career in the film industry.

🚀 **Looking Ahead:** My goal is to elevate my web development skills. I'm eager to bridge the gap between front end and back end development, believing that a holistic understanding of both realms is crucial for innovation and growth.
